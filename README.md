# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
1st import numpy as np
### Step 2: 
assign matrix to A.
### Step 3: 
assign the inverse of A fromula to B.
### Step 4: 
after assigning print B.
## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.

#Developed by: YENDLURI CHANDANA

#RegisterNumber:23011258

import numpy as np

A=[[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,-1,2]]

B=np.linalg.inv(A)

print(B)

```
## Output:
